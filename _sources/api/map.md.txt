# Map and Product

There are often mulitple flavors of the map and product macros
signified by the `EVAL` and `SEQ` components in the macro name. `EVAL`
indicates that the macro recursively expands the result which is
typically the desired result. `SEQ` indicates the the macro operates
on sequences as opposed to lists.
